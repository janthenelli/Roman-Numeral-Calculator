Documentation for hatPrecedence

hatPrecedence()
	-provides the special behavior that is performed by exponent operators
		-the exponent operator ^ is resolved right to left
		-2^2^3 resolves to 2^8, as opposed to 4^3
	-simplifies special case expressions
		- redundant parenthesis such as (II)^(II) resolves into II^II
	-after parenthesis are resolved, the final equation involving ^ is evaluated from right to left
	-outputs remaining expression after solving exponents
